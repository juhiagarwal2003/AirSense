# AirSense
AirSense predicts air quality using Lasso and Ridge Regression. This project preprocesses air quality data, handles missing values, scales features, and trains models to predict pollutant levels. Results are compared with SVR, and visualizations highlight the relationship between sensor readings and pollutants.
